**COURSE OVERVIEW**

This survey course offers critical perspectives on whether data and technology create a more just society. We will explore a range of subjects, including: Big data, digital privacy, surveillance, &quot;smart&quot; cities, peer production, hacking, piracy, and algorithmic bias. The course content draws from Hackers on Planet Earth, Chaos Communications Congress, guest speakers, and traditional classroom material, such as book chapters, academic journals, and newspapers. With three in-class workshops – a mesh networking demo, a power mapping hackathon, and a cryptoparty – students will gain hands-on experience that will change how they approach technology in their lives.

**GRADING**

My goal is to expand your perspective and challenge the assumptions you bring to the classroom. Your learning requires focus. It is hard to focus if you are worrying about what grade you will get. I promise that my grades will never be punitive. The grade you get will reflect your effort and your growth as a critical thinker. Here is how your grade will be divided:

- ****** Participation ****and**** attendance **=** 50% of your grade.** If for some reason you are not able to participate in class due to a learning difference, please let me know and we will find a way for you to demonstrate your learning. I consider active listening to be a form of participation.
- ****** In-class quizzes = 10% of your grade.**
- ****** In-class debate = 10% of your grade.**
- ****** Final project, paper, or presentation = 30% of your grade.**

Extra credit to students who can go 24 hours without checking their phones.

**ATTENDANCE/ASSIGNMENT POLICY**

ExCollege classes are designed and conducted as seminars. The educational concept behind the seminar structure assumes a level of maturity and commitment on the part of all participants. Unlike a lecture class, everyone is responsible for the learning that takes place. **Therefore, all students are expected to attend every class meeting and to come prepared.** This is particularly important given that we meet only once a week. That said,if you need to miss class, please notify me in advance. Unexplained absences will negatively affect my assessment of your work in the course.

Assignments are expected to be completed by their due dates. If you cannot complete an assignment by the due date, please notify me in advance.

**DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION STATEMENT**

The class will be an open learning environment that embraces a diversity of thoughts, perspectives and experiences, and honors your identities (including race, gender, class, sexuality, religion, ability, etc.). If you have a name and/or set of pronouns that differ from those that appear in your official Tufts records, please let me know. If you feel like your participation in the class is being impacted by your experiences outside of class, please don&#39;t hesitate to come and talk with me. If something was said in class, by anyone, that made you feel uncomfortable, please talk to me about it.

**CLASSROOM ACCOMMODATIONS**

Tufts University values the diversity of our students, staff, and faculty, recognizing the important contribution each student makes to our unique community. Students with disabilities are assured that the Student Accessibility Services office will work with each student individually to ensure access to all aspects of student life. Tufts is committed to providing equal access and support to all students through the provision of reasonable accommodations so that each student may access their curricula and achieve their personal and academic potential. If you have a disability that requires reasonable accommodations, please contact the Student Accessibility Services office at 617-627-4539, or through their email at [Accessibility@tufts.edu](https://sites.tufts.edu/excollegespring/courseprep/syllabus/Accessibility@tufts.edu), to make an appointment with the director to determine appropriate accommodations. Please be aware that accommodations cannot be enacted retroactively, making timeliness a critical aspect for their provision.
